R10.5 Events
event object:/ a event object is an object that has listener methods
event source:/ event source is the user-interface component, such as a button, that generates a particular event.
event listener:/ event listener belongs to a class created by the application programmer.
Its methods describe te action to be taken when an event occurs.


R10.6 actionPerformed
1/ the event source, such as a button-click, calls the actionPerformed method.
2/ the call to actionPerformed method occurs when there is user input to the program.


R10.11 Inner class and event-listeners
1/ First, listener classes are usually short. Placing them as inner classes
can avoid clustering up the remainder of the project. Second, inner classes can access
instance variables and methods of surrounding class.
2/ Yes, we can still implement event listeners without inner classes.
In this case, the event listeners can receive the variable and methods
of the event source as constructor or method arguments.


R10.14 Object hierarchies
1/ setWrapStyleWord
2/ setEditable
3/ setBackground


R10.22 Graphic methods
We can use random method to generate colors on 2 sides.
1/ use random number generator: import java.util.Random
2/ in the method, create a Random object: Random rand = new Random();
3/ replace the two lines: g.setColor(Color.GREEN); and: g.setColor(Color.RED)
with: g.setColor(new Color(rand.nextInt(255),rand.nextInt(255),rand.nextInt(255)));


R11.2 Layout managers
The layout manager allows for more sophisticated arrangements within the container.


R11.11 ButtonGroup
The buttons in the button group are mutually exclusive such that only one button can be selected at a time.
This functionality is suitable for radio buttons.
The check boxes, on the other hand, do not exclude each other.


R11.19 Types of Events
What is the difference between an ActionEvent and a MouseEvent?
1/ An ActionEvent includes button clicks and timer ticks. It is invoked when the button push occurs.
2/ An MouseEvent is more complex, it includes mousePressed, mouseReleased, mouseClicked, mouseEntered and mouseExited.
It listens to the mouse operation constantly.

R11.20 Events
1/ An action event object carries information of a button click and the associated time stamp.
2/ A mouse event object carries additional information of mouse button press-hold and release,
and the coordinate information of the mouse cursor.

R11.21 ActionListener versus MouseListener
1/ ActionListener is used to handle one event which is the click of a button.
2/ MouseListener can be used to track the states of the mouse operation, including mouse press-hold, release, click,
and the position of the mouse cursor on screen.
