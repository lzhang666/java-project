R1.5 The following are all benefits to using Java over machine code:
1/ Java bytecode is platform independent and may be run on any system that has a JVM. This quality is known as portability.
2/ Java JIT compilers can run efficient Java programs as fast or faster than machine code programs
3/ Java is memory-managed. This reduces about 95% of runtime errors (mostly memory-related) as compared to unmanaged code.
4/ Java was designed for networking and the Internet in mind; and it is generally safer than machine code
5/ With the introduction of Java8, Java is now a declarative and functional programming language.


R2.4 Translating math expressions to Java:
1/ s = s_0 + v_0_t + 1/2 * g * Math.pow(t , 2)
2/ FV = PV * Math.pow((1+ INT/100), YRS)
3/ G = 4 * Math.pow(Math.PI, 2) * Math.pow(a, 3) /(Math(p, 2)*(m1 + m2))
4/ c = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2) - 2 * a * b * Math.cos(gamma))


R2.7 Understanding integer operations, order of precedence, and integer division:
a/ 8
b/ 1
c/ 17
d/ 17.5
e/ 17
f/ 18


R2.14 How the compiler interprets primitive values:
2: interpreted as an integer
2.0: interpreted as a double
'2': interpreted as a character
"2": interpreted as a string
"2.0": interpreted a a string


R2.17 Pseudocode understanding:
01 read full name input as a string fullName
02 initialize monogram as an empty string
03 for i = 0, i < the length of string, i++
04     if i = 0
05         monogram += fullName[i]
06     else if the character at index i of fullName = " "
07         monogram += fullName[i+1]
08 output monogram


R2.22 More pseudocode - you do not need to draw a diagram for this question:
01 names = "SunMonTueWedThuFriSat"
02 dayNum = 4
03 the starting position of the substring startPos = 4 * 3 = 12
04 with the length of the substring = 3
05 endPos = 12 + 3 = 15
06 day = names.substring(12, 15) = "Wed"


R3.19 Pseudocode for grade problem:
Enter Score as an integer
initialize Grade as an empty string
if Score >= 90 and Score <= 100
    Grade = "A"
else if Score >= 80 and Score <= 89
    Grade = "B"
else if Score >= 70 and Score <= 79
    Grade = "C"
else if Score >= 60 and Score <= 69
    Grade = "D"
else if Score < 60
    Grade = "F"
output Grade


R3.30 Boolean expressions:
a/ false
b/ true
c/ true
d/ true
e/ false
f/ false
g/ false
h/ true


R4.12 Implementing loops:
1/ while loop: while loop is used to repeat the loop body as long as a statement stays true

2/ for loop: for loop is used when a variable runs from a starting point to an ending point with a constant increment or decrement

3/ do loop: do loop is used when the loop body needs to be executed for at least once


R4.14 Calendar problem
01 print the header as string "Su  M  T  W Th  F Sa"
02 print the spaces in the 1st date line as a string "          1  2  3  4"
03 on the next line, for i=5, i<=31, i++
04     if i < 10
05         print single space string " " before the date
06         print i as date
07         if i == 4
08              print new line character "\n"
09         else
10              print single space string " " after the date
11     else
12         if i==11 or i==18 or i==25
13              print new line character "\n"
14         else
15              print single space as string " "
